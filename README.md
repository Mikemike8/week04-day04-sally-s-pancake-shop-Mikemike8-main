When a user clicks on the "Create Order" button for a menu item, a new order element should be added to the "Orders" div on [line 14 in the html file](./index.html).
 - Configure an onclick event for the "Create Order" buttons that injects a new order element into the orders div
    <details>
    <summary>Select orders div</summary>

    ```javascript
    var ordersHTML = document.getElementByid("orders")
    ```
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Create new order element</summary>

    ```javascript
    var newOrder = `<div class="order">
                        <img src="./assets/pancakes.png" alt="pancake">
                    </div>`
    ```
    </details>

    <details>
    <summary>Add new order element to inside of order div.</summary>

    #### I present to you two diffent ways to do this but only one is correct.

    ```javascript
    //Option 1
    ordersHTML.innerHTML = newOrder
    //Option 2
    ordersHTML.innerHTML = ordersHTML.innerHTML + newOrder
    ```
    #### Whats the difference between the two options? Try them both out

</details>
<br/>


A user should be able to remove an Order element by clicking on it
 - Add a button that says "Ready" to the order elements
    <details>
    <summary>Add button to the html string for new orders</summary>

    ```javascript
    //add button element inside the order div
    var newOrder = `<div class="order">
                        <img src="./assets/pancakes.png" alt="pancake">
                    </div>`
    ```
    </details>
    <br>

 - Add an onclick event to the "Ready" button that removes the button's parent element (the order element) from the page.
     <details>
    <summary>this code should help </summary>

    ```javascript
    //modify this html string by adding a button element inside the order div
    var elementThisEventWasTriggeredOn = event.target
    var parentElement = elementThisEventWasTriggeredOn.parent
    parentElement.remove()
    ```
    </details>

<details>
    <summary>Preview</summary>
  <img src="./Example/Part3.gif" width=400>
</details>
<br/>


A user should be able to create two orders for a menu item at once.
  - Add a button to each menu item that says "Create 2 Orders"
  - Add an onclick event to these buttons that creates two orders instead of one.

<br>

### **Part 4: Create varying multiples of Orders at once**
<details>
    <summary>Preview</summary>
  <img src="./Example/Part4.gif" width=400>
</details>
<br/>

A user should be able to create any number of orders for a menu item at once.
- Add an [input element to accept a number](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_input_type_number.asp) of orders to create from the user
- Set the default value of the input element to be 3
- Add a button below the input element that says "Create Orders"
- Configure an onclick event for the button that reads the number from the input element and creates that many orders
    - Select the input element and save it to a variable called "pancakeInputHTML". ( Youll probably have to add an Id to the input element itself)
    - Access the value property on from the input element and save it to a variable called "pancakeOrders"
    - Configure a [for-loop to repeat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for#examples) some code for a number of iterations equal to the value of "pancakeOrders"
    - Place the code lines for creating a new order inside the for-loop
